Babel is a JavaScript compiler.

Babel is a tool that helps you write code in the latest version of JavaScript. When your supported environments don't support certain features natively, Babel will help you compile those features down to a supported version.

Babel has support for the latest version of JavaScript through *syntax transformers*. These plugins allow you to use new syntax, right now without waiting for browser support. 

通过 Babel，可以使用 JS 的最新语法，Babel 会帮我们进行转换（syntax transformers）。
